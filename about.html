                        Since opening our doors in 1988, Tako Grill has become a part of Bethesda's warm and vibrant community. We serve authentic Japanese meals with the highest quality ingredients to warmly welcome our long-time customers and new friends in the neighbourhood!

                        <br>
                        As Tako Grill was built on the philosophy of providing our customers with genuine Japanese cuisine, we  work closely with local farmers and artisans to ensure that our food is as authentic as possible. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We are famous for our takoyaki, a ball-shaped meal with various filling, but our menu hosts a wide range of dishes that will satisfy your cravings and keep you wanting more. The scent of herbs and garlic naturally wafts from the kitchen, and the sizzling sound of freshly prepared food will give you a dining experience like no other.
